### **New Ways to Hack**
1. **Social Engineering Missions**  
   Add a layer of missions where players "phish" for admin passwords or trick AIs into granting temporary access. These require solving logic puzzles or decoding messages.

2. **Backdoor Injections**  
   Players can write simple scripts or commands to install backdoors, granting incremental "hacked level" increases over time instead of instant progression. 

3. **Brute Force Mode**  
   A high-risk/high-reward hacking technique that can bypass several security levels but risks "locking out" the server for a cooldown period if unsuccessful.

4. **Exploit Builder**  
   Introduce a mini-tool for players to assemble hacking tools using parts (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection). Parts can be unlocked through progression or mini-games.

### **Fun Mini-games**
1. **Code Cracker**  
   A time-based puzzle game where players match binary patterns or arrange snippets of "code" to bypass firewalls.

2. **Decryption Maze**  
   Navigate a grid-like puzzle to "decrypt" a password. Each turn costs energy but yields a reward (like reduced security).

3. **Frequency Sniper**  
   A rhythm-based game where players match input keys to displayed frequencies to intercept data packets and weaken server defenses.

4. **Hacking Duels**  
   Compete against an AI or other players (multiplayer) to hack a server first. Winning grants extra currency or rare loot.

### **What to Do with the Money**
1. **Upgrade Tools**  
   - Faster hacking (reduces time needed to increase HackedLevel).
   - Higher mining efficiency (boost profit per second).  
   - Tools to reveal hidden servers or reduce cooldown times.  

2. **Expand Operations**  
   - Purchase additional servers to increase your network capacity.
   - Invest in "auto-mining" bots that work independently.  

3. **Personalization**  
   - Custom terminal skins or color schemes.
   - Unlock themes like "retro green," "cyberpunk purple," or "matrix rain."
   - Fun titles/badges displayed during "list" commands or multiplayer.  

4. **Corporate Espionage**  
   Spend money to bribe informants or buy "blueprints" of high-value servers for better hacking strategies.

5. **Black Market**  
   Buy rare scripts, exploits, or temporary boosts (e.g., double mining output for 5 minutes).

### **New Mechanics and Features**
1. **Server Reputation System**  
   Servers gain or lose reputation depending on how aggressively they're hacked. High-reputation servers generate more profit but have tougher security.

2. **Server Tiers**  
   Introduce server "rarity" tiers (e.g., Common, Rare, Legendary). Higher tiers yield better rewards but require advanced tactics to hack.

3. **Event Servers**  
   Randomly spawn "event servers" with special conditions, such as limited-time access, increased profits, or hidden dangers.

4. **Rogue AI Defense**  
   Add "boss servers" that deploy an AI to counter your hacking attempts. Beat the AI in logic-based puzzles or reflex games to take control.

5. **Server States**  
   Servers can randomly go into "protected mode" (boosted security) or "vulnerable mode" (weakened defenses). Use commands like "probe" to detect their state.

### **Player-to-Player Interaction**
1. **Competitive Leaderboards**  
   Players can compare total profits, hacked servers, or mining efficiency globally or with friends.

2. **Server Raids**  
   Team up with other players to hack heavily fortified servers and split massive rewards.

3. **Player-owned Servers**  
   Players can purchase or build their own servers for others to hack, setting the difficulty and earning passive income from failed attempts.

### **Progression System**
1. **Skill Trees**  
   Allow players to invest in abilities:
   - **Speed Hacking**: Decrease hack time.
   - **Mining Efficiency**: Boost profits.
   - **Security Exploits**: Bypass specific defenses.
   - **Recon Tools**: Reveal high-value servers.  

2. **Prestige Mode**  
   Once a certain goal is achieved (e.g., $1 million), players can reset their progress for multipliers or exclusive rewards in a new game loop.

3. **Storyline Missions**  
   Introduce a story where the player uncovers secrets about a rogue tech conglomerate, adding narrative depth.
