## Server Management
- `scan <server>` - Analyze a server to reveal its vulnerabilities and potential exploits
- `upgrade <server>` - Spend earned money to increase a server's mining power
- `connect <server>` - Switch your active connection to a different server
- `disconnect` - Safely terminate current server connection
- `status` - Show detailed statistics about current server

## Network Operations
- `ping` - Test connection speed to servers, affecting hack success rate
- `route` - Show network map of discovered servers
- `trace` - Track other players' activities in multiplayer mode
- `proxy` - Hide your activities temporarily (costs money)

## Advanced Hacking
- `bruteforce` - Slower but guaranteed hack success
- `exploit` - Fast but risky hack attempt with potential consequences
- `patch` - Defend your controlled servers from other players
- `backdoor` - Install permanent access to a server

# Minigames

## Password Cracker
- Grid-based minigame where players match patterns to break encryption
- Higher difficulty servers have more complex patterns
- Success reduces required hack attempts

## Network Maze
- Navigate through a visual representation of server connections
- Avoid detection systems

I've designed a comprehensive expansion that adds depth while maintaining the core gameplay loop. The new features focus on:

1. Educational value through realistic networking concepts
2. Engaging gameplay mechanics with various minigames
3. Social features promoting player interaction
4. Progressive difficulty with meaningful choices
5. Multiple paths for advancement

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect? I could also create specific implementation details for any of these features.
