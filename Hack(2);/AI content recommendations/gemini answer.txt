New Commands & Hacking Mechanics:

*   scan \[server_name]: Scans a specific server, revealing more detailed information beyond what `list` provides. This could include:
    *   Firewall type (affects hacking difficulty).
    *   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) level (chance of getting detected during hacking).
    *   Available ports (determines which attack vectors are possible).
    *   Running services (potential vulnerabilities to exploit).
*   exploit \[server_name] \[exploit_type]: Instead of a simple `hack`, introduce different types of exploits based on vulnerabilities:
    *   buffer_overflow: High risk, high reward. Faster hacking but higher chance of triggering IDS.
    *   sql_injection: Medium risk, medium reward. More reliable than buffer overflow.
    *   port_scan \[port_number]: Scans a specific port on the target server. If the port is open, it reveals information about the service running on it, potentially revealing vulnerabilities.
    *   brute_force \[port_number]: Attempts to crack a password for a specific service running on a port.
*   bypass \[firewall_type]: Requires specific resources or skills to bypass different firewalls. Example: `bypass firewall_a`
*   crack \[password_hash]: Attempts to crack a password hash obtained through exploits. This could involve mini-games or resource expenditure.
*   upgrade \[component]: Allows players to upgrade their own system to improve hacking capabilities:
    *   cpu: Increases hacking speed and success rate.
    *   ram: Allows running more complex exploits simultaneously.
    *   network: Reduces latency and improves scan speed.
*   logoff: Disconnects from the current server. Important for avoiding detection after a successful hack or if the IDS is triggered.
*   trace \[ip_address]: Traces an IP address, potentially revealing the location of other servers or hidden networks.

New Ways and Reasons to Hack:

*   Black Market Contracts: Introduce missions or contracts that reward players for hacking specific servers or performing certain tasks. Examples:
    *   Data theft: Steal sensitive information from a corporate server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Take down a competitor's server.
    *   Espionage: Install backdoors on target servers for long-term access.
*   Server Upgrades: Servers could have upgradeable components that enhance their security, power, or profitability. Players could hack servers to steal these upgrades or sabotage them.
*   Faction Wars: Introduce factions that compete for control of servers. Players can join a faction and participate in hacking wars.
*   Dynamic Security Levels: Instead of static security levels, introduce systems that adapt to player activity. Frequent attacks on a server could increase its security level.
*   Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Introduce a chance of getting detected during hacking attempts. If detected, players might face consequences like fines, temporary system shutdowns, or being traced by authorities.

Fun Mini-Games:

*   Password Cracking: A mini-game where players need to solve puzzles or complete challenges to crack passwords.
*   Firewall Bypass: A puzzle-based mini-game where players need to reroute network traffic to bypass a firewall.
*   Code Injection: A mini-game where players need to insert malicious code into a program to exploit a vulnerability.

Things to do with the Money:

*   Upgrades: As mentioned before, players can upgrade their own system to improve hacking capabilities.
*   Software/Tools: Purchase new hacking tools or software that provide access to new exploits or improve hacking efficiency.
*   Server Hosting: Players could purchase their own servers to generate passive income or host their own services.
*   Bribes/Black Market Deals: Players could bribe officials to avoid consequences for their actions or purchase illegal information on the black market.
*   Cosmetics: Purchase cosmetic items to customize their terminal or profile.

And More:

*   Tutorial System: A more robust tutorial system to introduce players to the different commands and mechanics.
*   Help Command: A `help` command that provides information about specific commands or game mechanics.
*   Save/Load System: Allow players to save and load their progress.
*   Visual Enhancements: While still text-based, consider adding some visual flair with colors, ASCII art, or simple animations.

By implementing these additions, "Hack(2);" can become a much more complex and engaging hacking simulation with a greater sense of progression and player agency.
